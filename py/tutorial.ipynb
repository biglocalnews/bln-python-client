    "## Why GraphQL?\n",
    "1. Concise: ask and you shall receive; REST storms become a single query.\n",
    "2. Fast: you only pay for the data you want; no need to overfetch to get the 'id' or 'name' you want.\n",
    "3. Flexible: less versioning, i.e. no 'REST API v3', models/nodes can be added to the graph seamlessly.\n",
    "4. Supported: Facebook, GitHub, AirBnB, Uber, Lyft, etc are using and building on it.\n",
    "5. Ease: frontend code was dramatically simplified using GraphQL + the Apollo client. We got free/automatic caching of queries and updates, built-in pagination, auto-generated and statically typed documentation, auto-generated typescript files, and soon there will be auto-generated clients in every language. We also completely jettisoned all other state management tools like redux."

    "## GraphQL Overview\n",
    "1. GraphQL is a different way of thinking about your data. Each of your models/entities is a node and they are connected by edges. You can traverse the graph however you like, collecting the data you want as you go (as long as you're authorized to do so).\n",
    "2. There are two primary actions: query and mutate. Queries do what you think: they allow you to pull data down from the graph. Mutations create or change data in the graph.\n",
    "3. Every entity has a globally unique 'id'. So, if you have issues, make a github issue and note the 'id' (don't worry, only those with authorization or the BLN team can view the data represented by that 'id')."
